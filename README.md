# Virtual_Whiteboard
This project is a virtual paint application built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It allows users to draw on a digital canvas in real-time using only hand gestures tracked through their webcam. The core idea is to use MediaPipe to detect and track the landmarks of a user's hand, specifically focusing on the index finger and thumb. When the index finger is extended and sufficiently apart from the thumb, the application enters drawing mode, allowing the user to draw lines on a virtual canvas with the tip of their finger. The interface includes a toolbar at the top of the screen with color selection options (blue, green, red, yellow) and a "CLEAR" button to reset the canvas. By hovering the fingertip over these buttons, users can switch colors or clear the screen. The entire experience is touch-free and relies solely on natural gestures, providing an intuitive and interactive way to draw.

The application uses OpenCV for video capture and rendering, MediaPipe for robust hand tracking, and NumPy for efficient array operations. All colors are stored in separate deques to allow for continuous line drawing. It also features gesture logic to differentiate between drawing and changing tools by comparing the vertical distance between the index fingertip and thumb. To run the project, ensure Python is installed along with the opencv-python, mediapipe, and numpy libraries. Launch the app using python main.py, and it will open your webcam, allowing you to interact with the drawing interface in real time. This project is ideal for learning computer vision fundamentals, gesture recognition, and building real-time interactive systems using Python.
